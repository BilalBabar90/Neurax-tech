Intellect Chat:
Enterprise RAG Platform
for Intelligent MultiAgent Conversations
Overview
Intellect Chat is a sophisticated, self-hosted
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
platform engineered to power intelligent,
context-aware, and secure conversational
AI applications. Designed for enterprises
requiring deep customization and data
sovereignty, it leverages a multi-agent
architecture built on state-of-the-art opensource
LLMs
and
vector
retrieval
technology. The platform seamlessly
integrates diverse knowledge sources
shared, agent-specific, and user-provided
to deliver highly accurate, personalized
responses. By automating complex query
resolution and ensuring all data processing
remains
on-premise,
Intellect
Chat
enhances user engagement, operational
efficiency, and strict compliance with a
strong emphasis on privacy and custom
agent-based workflows

Solution & Implementation

1. Architected a scalable, multiagent RAG system using gRPC
and Docker to handle complex
query routing, parallel
knowledge retrieval, and
context-aware response
generation, all within a secure
on-premise environment.
2. Engineered a sophisticated
vector processing pipeline that
chunks, embeds, and stores
diverse data types (documents,
images, audio) into a highperformance vector database
for ultra-fast semantic
similarity search.
3. Implemented a dynamic agent
selection framework, featuring
a supervisor agent for
intelligent query routing and
specialized agents for domainspecific tasks.
4. Developed advanced prompt
engineering and composition
techniques to optimally
combine retrieved context with
user queries.

Customer ProÔ¨Åle
A discerning enterprise client requiring a
secure, intelligent knowledge management
Industry: Enterprise Technology
Data Policy: Strict On-Premise

Results
The Intellect Chat platform was successfully
developed and deployed as a custom RAG
solution, providing the client with a
powerful and private conversational AI
engine.
The
system
demonstrates
exceptional performance in processing
complex queries across multiple knowledge
domains, significantly reducing response
time and improving answer accuracy. The
client now benefits from a unified platform
that automates customer support, internal
knowledge retrieval, and data analysis, all
while maintaining full control over their
sensitive
data
within
their
own
infrastructure. This project showcases deep
expertise in building full-stack, multi-modal
AI systems with a strong emphasis on
privacy
and
custom
agent-based
workflows.
