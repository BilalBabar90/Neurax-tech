ZazuAI: On-Premise
AI Meeting
Assistant for
Automated Minutes
Overview
ZazuAI is an advanced, self-hosted
meeting intelligence platform that
automatically records, transcribes, and
summarizes discussions into actionable
minutes. Designed for organizations
that prioritize data security, ZazuAI
leverages a powerful dual-pipeline
architecture built on state-of-the-art
open-source models. It delivers realtime transcription with live speaker
identification during meetings and
generates
high-accuracy,
diarized
transcripts for post-meeting analysis.
By
automatically
extracting
key
decisions, action items, and topics
without
ever
requiring
cloud
connectivity, ZazuAI eliminates manual
note-taking, ensures privacy, and
significantly
enhances
meeting
productivity and accountability.

Solution & Implementation

1. Engineered a dual-pipeline
architecture to simultaneously
provide low-latency real-time
transcription and high-accuracy
post-processed analysis, all
hosted on-premise for
maximum data security.
2. Integrated Whisper.cpp and
PyAnnote's DIART for the realtime pipeline, delivering instant,
speaker-identified transcripts
during live meetings.
3. Utilized WhisperX with forced
alignment and PyAnnote in the
post-processing pipeline to
generate a definitive, wordlevel accurate transcript with
superior speaker segmentation.
4. Developed a custom Llama.cpppowered engine with
engineered prompts to
automatically generate
structured meeting minutes,
including summaries, action
items, and topics.

Customer ProÔ¨Åle
A leading enterprise client from the UAE
seeking a secure, on-premise AI solution.
Industry: Enterprise Technology
Country: United Arab Emirates (UAE)

Results
ZazuAI was successfully developed and
deployed as a custom on-premise solution
for the UAE-based client. The system
achieves 96% transcription accuracy and
80% diarization accuracy on full audio
processing, meeting critical performance
thresholds while providing superior data
sovereignty. The client now benefits from a
secure, automated tool that captures
meeting intelligence, ensures no critical
detail is lost, and tracks every action item,
all within their own private infrastructure.
This project demonstrates deep expertise in
building full-stack, privacy-focused AI
applications for discerning international
clients.
